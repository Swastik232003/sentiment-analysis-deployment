       "'i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to lovethis was the most id laughed at one of woodys comedies in years dare i say a decade while ive never been impressed with scarlet johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young womanthis may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends'"
